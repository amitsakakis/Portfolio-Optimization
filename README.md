<h1 align="center">Stock Portfolio Optimization App</h1>

## Project Description

This project is a Stock Portfolio Optimization Calculator utilizing various optimization techniques to maximize portfolio performance. It includes graphical visualization of the efficient frontier and portfolio metrics. It is a web-hosted interactive application, hosted using [Streamlit's](https://streamlit.io) functionality.

## Portfolio Optimization

The **Portfolio Optimization** process aims to allocate assets in a way that maximizes returns and minimizes risk based on specific criteria. This application supports optimization using:

- **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures the performance of the portfolio compared to a risk-free asset, adjusted for risk.
- **CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk)**: Estimates the expected loss of an investment in the worst-case scenario.
- **Sortino Ratio**: Similar to the Sharpe ratio but only considers downside risk (negative returns).
- **Volatility**: Represents the degree of variation in trading prices, indicating stability.

## Portfolio Optimization Assumptions

Portfolio Optimization Model Assumptions:

- Historical Returns as Predictors: The model assumes that historical returns are indicative of future performance, using past stock data to estimate future returns.
- Normal Distribution of Returns: The model assumes that asset returns follow a normal distribution, which simplifies the calculation of portfolio performance metrics.
- No Transaction Costs: The model assumes there are no transaction costs associated with buying or selling assets, which could otherwise impact the optimization results.
- Full Investment: The model assumes that all available capital is fully invested in the portfolio, with no cash reserves.
- Fixed Time Horizon: The model assumes a fixed investment period, as specified by the start and end dates provided.

## The Efficient Frontier

The **Efficient Frontier** represents the set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk. It is a key concept in Modern Portfolio Theory. This application leverages **multiprocessing** to efficiently calculate and plot the efficient frontier.

## The Ticker Tape

The application includes a real-time ticker tape displaying the current prices and changes of top stocks. This feature is implemented be fetching realtime data for top stock tickers from yfinance. The ticker tape shows the latest prices and price changes, scrolling across the screen to provide continuous updates. This is of course just for cosmetic puropses.
